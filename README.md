# Carbon-Cathode-Tubes
Carbonite tubes glazed on outside with glass. Electroplated on inside with chrome. The tubes are lenghtened to the resonance of the required frequency. The tubes are pumped full of power at the frequnecy. The tubes will resonate with electricity like a capacitor after teh energy sources has stopped. -Ben Roberts
