# Carbon-Cathode-Tubes
Carbonite tubes glazed on outside with glass. Electroplated on inside with chrome. The tubes are lenghtened to the resonance of the required frequency. The tubes are pumped full of power at the frequnecy. The tubes will resonate with electricity like a capacitor after the energy sources has stopped. The energy sources can be used to transmit tuned energy.
